    "What the results mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "-High declarative sentence percentage → The novel is heavily narrative-driven, focused on exposition, descriptions, and the progression of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Low interrogative percentage → Characters do not frequently ask direct questions; conversations are more monologue/exposition-based than Socratic or inquiry-focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Moderate dialogue sentences → Dialogue exists but is not the dominant feature. Tolstoy emphasizes large-scale events, internal reflections, and philosophical narration.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Rare exclamative sentences → Emotional outbursts are limited; Tolstoy uses restrained, measured tone except for rare dramatic moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Interpretation:\n",
    "War and Peace reads like a historical epic with measured storytelling. Its sentence structure supports a calm, expansive narrative style with a focus on description and reflection rather than emotional intensity or rapid conversational exchanges."
